# Geezer Tracker

Current scraping the Strava site periodically to get the data for the runs... and they keep disabling my account...

Feel free to open any issues and add any contributions to improve it!

I will be finding better ways to fetch the runs from strava, but the easiest way would be if @hardestgeezer gave me an OAuth key so I can just download them through the API!

A very similar site exists at [whereisruss.vercel.app](https://whereisruss.vercel.app/) which I used for UI inspiration but wanted to add some more metrics and couldn't find the source code for the site to contribute directly.
