# Run Africa Hardest Geezer Tracker

Currently having to manually download each run and add it as the Strava API is... interesting... (and they banned my account for trying to web scape lol)

Feel free to open any issues and add any contributions to improve it

I will be finding better ways to fetch the runs from strava, but the easiest way would be if @hardestgeezer gave me an OAuth key so I can just download them through the API!
